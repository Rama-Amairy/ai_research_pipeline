    "Summary": "Sport is a form of physical activity or game. Often competitive and organized, sports use, maintain, or improve physical ability and skills. They also provide enjoyment to participants and, in some cases, entertainment to spectators. Many sports exist, with different participant numbers, some are done by a single person with others being done by hundreds. Most sports take place either in teams or competing as individuals. Some sports allow a \"tie\" or \"draw\", in which there is no single winner; others provide tie-breaking methods to ensure one winner. A number of contests may be arranged in a tournament format, producing a champion. Many sports leagues make an annual champion by arranging games in a regular sports season, followed in some cases by playoffs.\nSport is generally recognised as system of activities based in physical athleticism or physical dexterity, with major competitions admitting only sports meeting this definition. Some organisations, such as the Council of Europe, preclude activities without any physical element from classification as sports. However, a number of competitive, but non-physical, activities claim recognition as mind sports. The International Olympic Committee who oversee the Olympic Games recognises both chess and bridge as sports. SportAccord, the international sports federation association, recognises five non-physical sports: chess, bridge, draughts, Go and xiangqi. However, they limit the number of mind games which can be admitted as sports. Sport is usually governed by a set of rules or customs, which serve to ensure fair competition. Winning can be determined by physical events such as scoring goals or crossing a line first. It can also be determined by judges who are scoring elements of the sporting performance, including objective or subjective measures such as technical performance or artistic impression.\nRecords of performance are often kept, and for popular sports, this information may be widely announced or reported in sport news. Sport is also a major source of entertainment for non-participants, with spectator sport drawing large crowds to sport venues, and reaching wider audiences through broadcasting. Sport betting is in some cases severely regulated, and in others integral to the sport.\nAccording to A.T. Kearney, a consultancy, the global sporting industry is worth up to $620 billion as of 2013. The world's most accessible and practised sport is running, while association football is the most popular spectator sport.",
    "answer": "The \"best\" sport is highly subjective and depends on individual preferences, interests, and goals. Different sports offer unique benefits and cater to various audiences. Here are some factors to consider when determining what might be the \"best\" sport for you:\n\n1. **Physical Fitness**: If your goal is to improve overall physical health, sports like running, swimming, or cycling are excellent for cardiovascular fitness. Team sports like soccer, basketball, or volleyball can improve agility, coordination, and endurance.\n\n2. **Skill Development**: If you enjoy developing specific skills, sports like tennis, golf, or gymnastics focus on precision, technique, and mental focus.\n\n3. **Social Interaction**: Team sports such as soccer, rugby, or baseball provide opportunities for social interaction and teamwork, which can be rewarding for those who enjoy camaraderie.\n\n4. **Entertainment**: For spectators, sports like football (soccer), basketball, or American football are highly entertaining due to their fast-paced action and competitive nature.\n\n5. **Accessibility**: Running is often considered the most accessible sport because it requires minimal equipment and can be done almost anywhere. Similarly, sports like basketball or soccer are widely accessible due to their simple equipment needs.\n\n6. **Mind Sports**: If you prefer mental challenges over physical exertion, mind sports like chess, bridge, or Go might be more appealing.\n\n7. **Cultural Popularity**: In some regions, certain sports are deeply ingrained in the culture. For example, cricket is hugely popular in India, while American football dominates in the United States.\n\nUltimately, the \"best\" sport is the one that aligns with your personal interests, goals, and lifestyle.

    "Summary": "Sport was an American sports magazine. Launched in September 1946 by New York–based publisher Macfadden Publications, Sport pioneered the generous use of color photography—it carried eight full-color plates in its first edition. Sport predated the launch of Sports Illustrated by eight years, and was responsible for bringing several editorial innovations to the genre. Sport differed from Sports Illustrated in that the former was a monthly magazine, while the latter had a weekly distribution.\nThe Sport Magazine Award, created in 1948, was initially given to outstanding players in 11 major sports. In 1955, the magazine instituted an award honoring the outstanding player in baseball's World Series, which became the World Series Most Valuable Player Award and continues to be awarded by Major League Baseball. Later, Sport expanded this approach to recognize pre-eminent postseason performers in the four major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada.\nSport was published continually between its launch and August 2000, when its then-owner, British publisher EMAP PLC, made the decision to close the money-losing title. As of 2016, the photo archive of Sport, a collection of 20th-century sports photography in North America, is housed in Canada in Toronto, Ontario, and Vancouver, British Columbia, at The Sport Gallery.",

    "answer": "The \"best\" sport is subjective and depends on personal preferences, cultural influences, and what you value in a sport—whether it's physical fitness, teamwork, strategy, or individual achievement. However, if we consider popularity, global reach, and cultural impact, **soccer (football)** is often regarded as the world's most beloved sport. It’s played and watched by billions of people across the globe and unites diverse cultures.\n\nIn the context of \"Sport, Sport, Sport\" (a 1970 Soviet documentary film by Elem Klimov), the focus is on the beauty, dedication, and universality of sports, rather than ranking them. The film celebrates the spirit of athleticism and human achievement, suggesting that the \"best\" sport might be the one that inspires and moves you personally.\n\nSo, the \"best\" sport is ultimately the one that resonates most with you!",
